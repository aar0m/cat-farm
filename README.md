# Welcome to Aaron's Animal Farm

This Animal Farm project is the resulting product of tasking an undergraduate
named Aaron Ramos, who once knew nothing about object-oriented programming, 
let alone C or C++, with the goal of constructing a usable API from scratch. 
Currently, this API allows a user to instantiate a custom Animal.
_This Animal Farm was built under the tutelage of Professor Mark Nelson, 
renowned magician and passionate cat enthusiast, someone whom I have grown to 
admire and aspire to emulate as a software engineer, and Rachel Watanabe, the
most reliable graduate student known to man (probably) and someone who has 
graciously put up with my coding problems (thank you Rachel!)._

## Lessons Exercised by Building Animal Farm
![CLion](images/coding.png)
* Understanding the difference between C and C++
* Declaring and implementing _classes_
  * Difference between .h and .cpp files
  * Inheritance of _classes_ (parent/child relation)
  * Various types of _members_ and _methods_ (static, abstract, etc.)
* Developing clean, constant, and *classy* documentation habits
* Writing _test driven_ code via **BOOST**
* Troubleshooting coding issues synchronous and asynchronously
* Internalizing feedback from code reviews
* Utilizing foreign API primarily through documentation
* Learning that Professor Mark may be ~~a bunch of cats in a human disguise~~ a really smart software engineer

| Assignment    | Description                                                                                                                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Animal Farm 0 | Instantiate the Farm in CLion & GitHub.  Ensure that Doxygen functions as intended. Create an ABOUT.md                                  |
| Animal Farm 1 | Learn about structures and get familiar with Clion by creating a simple Cat structure.                                                  |
| Animal Farm 2 | Create config.h and develop basic classes like Gender and Animal.                                                                       |
| Animal Farm 3 | Further develop Gender. Implement classes Node, Container, and SingleLinkedList. Learn how basic methods related to a SingleLinkedList. |
| Animal Farm 4 | Develop Mammal class and a selection sort method for SingleLinkedList.                                                                  |
| Animal Farm 5 | Learn how to use a provided Name class, how to port code, and refactoring code after breaking it.                                       |
| Animal Farm 6 | Publish project to the internet. Understand the difference between complete and "Done" with a capital 'D'.                              |
